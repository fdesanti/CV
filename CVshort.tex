\section{Research activity}
\textbf{\textcolor{black}{\hspace{0.4cm}$\circ\;$ Detection and Parameter Estimation of eccentric gravitational wave signals}}\vspace{0.05cm}\\
\indent There is evidence for the presence of many astrophysical formation channels within the
population of compact fusion objects we observe today.
Eccentricity is one of the key aspects in distinguishing and studying the sources of
gravitational waves and their astrophysical origin.\\
During my Master's thesis, I began research work in this area, focusing on the study of highly
eccentric close encounters ($e\sim1$) in dense stellar environments: an extremely challenging and
as yet undetected GW source type.
I developed a fast inference pipeline (\textsc{HYPERION}) based on Normalizing Flows and ML,
capable of performing accurate detection and full Bayesian parameter estimation several
orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods.\\
My work, already presented to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, has furthermore led to a
peer-reviewed publication as a first author in Physical Review D.
\medskip

\textbf{\textcolor{black}{\hspace{0.4cm}$\circ\;$ ML applied to the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge}}\vspace{0.05cm}\\
\indent Due to the enormous leap in sensitivity, the analysis of the Einstein Telescope data is
expected to face several challenges: e.g. the presence of multiple overlapped signals.\\
The ET Collaboration has therefore launched a Mock Data Challenge to test the capabilities of
various pipelines in signal extraction and parameter estimation. The results of this challenge
will provide crucial insights into the scientific potential of the Einstein Telescope.\\
During the period of my research fellowship, together with L. Papalini (PhD student in Pisa) I
started to tackle this problem adopting state-of-the-art ML Transformers. Our work aims at
identifyng the presence of merger signals from binary black holes and/or neutron stars and
provide parameter estimation (PE) in the case of overlapping sources. All this, in view of the Early Warning
strategy for electro-magnetic counterparts identification.\\
Our results were presented at the \href{https://indico.ego-gw.it/event/710/}{XIV ET Symposium (Maastrict)} and will be 
part of an upcoming publication.

\medskip

\textbf{\textcolor{black}{\hspace{0.4cm}$\circ\;$ The scientific impact of improving Virgo low frequency sensitivity}}\vspace{0.05cm}\\
\indent Virgo is expected to undergo a series of upgrades in the upcoming years. An improved low
frequency sensitivity implies higher detection rates, better sky-localization as well as the
chance to detect new astrophysical sources (like eccentric close encounters).\\
Quantifying the impact of such improvements is of vital importance in driving the roadmap of
updates and to asses the relevance of Virgo within the international network of detectors.\\
In this context, the work done during the fellowship period aimed at quantifying 
the scientific impact on eccentric burst sources by exploiting previously
developed tools and techniques.

\medskip

\textbf{\textcolor{black}{\hspace{0.4cm}$\circ\;$ Simulation Based Inference for population studies of Galactic binaries with LISA}}\vspace{0.05cm}\\
\indent The LISA space mission is expected to observe 
a variety of different sources all at the same time like massive black hole binaries, extreme mass ratio inspirals or 
Galactic compact binaries. Among these, Galactic compact binaries of double white dwarves, emitting nearly monochromatic waves, 
are expected to be the dominant source 
in the mHz band. Of $\sim10^7$ binaries in the Milky Way, a small fraction of tens to thousands will be actually resolvable by LISA. 
The unresolved ones will indeed produce a foreground (“confusion”) stochastic noise which must be accounted for in the recovery
of the other sources.
Recent works have shown that different astrophysical mechanism driving the binary evolution can produce sensibly different foreground noises. 
However, the extraction of the astrophysics from confusion noise still remains a non-trivial challenge in the context of the Global Fit.
My work explores an alternative approach based on Simulation Based Inference. This work represents a first step towards 
the linking of astrophysical populations to the output of a Global Fit.
